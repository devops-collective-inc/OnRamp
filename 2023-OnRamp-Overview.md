# OnRamp 2023 Overview

The DevOps Collective's OnRamp program returns for another year with a renewed focus and direction. This unique program is targeted to the new or up-and-coming IT professional looking to get a head start on automation, DevOps, and cloud technologies, as well as learning more about what a career in IT looks like today. The content will mix traditional presentations, demonstrations, and hands-on exercises led by veteran IT professionals.

>This is *not* an instructor-led PowerShell fundamentals course.

OnRamp attendees will enjoy a mix of content from the main conference track and the OnRamp program. Conference and OnRamp attendees are expected to adhere to a single track. Due to the nature of the OnRamp agenda, jumping between events is not allowed.

## Agenda

OnRamp attendees will have their own agenda that should include these topics:

+ An Introduction to Cloud Technologies
+ An Introduction to Automation Languages
+ Containers and Kubernetes
+ IT Career Skills
+ Test Driven Development
+ Certification and Career Advancement
+ Source control with Git and GitHub
+ DevOps Principles

This is not a complete outline; some content is subject to change. There will be opportunities for hands-on exercises. Detailed requirements will be announced later, but if you can run PowerShell 7 and Visual Studio Code, you should be fine.

## Pre-Conference Event

OnRamp attendees are strongly encouraged to enroll in the pre-conference PowerShell class. The main OnRamp program will have limited PowerShell content so if you need to get a jump on learning PowerShell 7, the pre-conference workshop should be a part of your plans. This is a separately ticketed event.
