# Next Steps

Thank you for attending this year's event. I hope it was a valuable experience for you. I know it was for me. I always learn something new, even from people who think they don't have anything to share. From my perspective, this is a list of items you can consider homework.

- Take what you learned and apply it to your career.
- Share what you learned with others. This could be as simple as demonstrating how to use a command to a co-worker. There is always someone who knows less than you.
- Continue to learn and grow. A great deal of the OnRamp agenda was introducing you to topics and technologies. Find something you need for work or that excites you and dig in.
- Finally, find ways to be a part of the PowerShell community. We've talked a lot about this during week. If you feel unsure about anything, feel free to drop me a message in Slack.

## Online Resources

Here is a short list of resources you can use to continue your PowerShell journey. The very first place you should bookmark is [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/). This is Microsoft's official PowerShell learning site. It is a great place to start.

Here is a list of other online resources:

- [PowerShell.org](https://powershell.org)
- [PowerShell.org Forums](https://powershell.org/forums)
- [PowerShell Discord channel](https://aka.ms/psdiscord)
- [PlanetPowerShell](https://www.planetpowershell.com/)
- [PowerShell Podcast](https://powershellpodcast.podbean.com/)

On social media, track the `#PowerShell` tag. This is terrific way to stay on top of what is happening in the community.

## Books

The one PowerShell book everyone will recommend to you is [Learn PowerShell in a Month of Lunches](https://www.manning.com/books/learn-powershell-in-a-month-of-lunches). Once you finish that you can read [Learn PowerShell Scripting in a Month of Lunches](https://www.manning.com/books/learn-powershell-scripting-in-a-month-of-lunches-second-edition). Once you finish those, you can read [The PowerShell Scripting and Toolmaking Book](https://leanpub.com/powershell-scripting-toolmaking). This book is designed as the definitive guide to PowerShell scripting and toolmaking.

Often, people don't know what to do with PowerShell. To help, I wrote [The PowerShell Practice Primer](https://leanpub.com/psprimer). This book is designed to help you learn PowerShell by doing. It is a collection of exercises and challenges to help you learn PowerShell starting from very simple to more complex. The exercises are written for Windows PowerShell 5.1 but most should also work in PowerShell 7 on Windows, although there might be a different PowerShell 7 solution.

## Video

You should subscribe to the [PowerShell.org YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@PowershellOrg). You will find recordings of past events. Eventually, you'll see recordings from this year's event.

If you are looking for more formal video-based training, I can speak first-hand to the quality and breadth of material from [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/). I have several courses on PowerShell and related topics. You can find my courses [here](https://app.pluralsight.com/profile/author/jeff-hicks). I know you can also find content on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) and [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/). And, of course, there is always YouTube.

I would also encourage you to ask others about learning resources they find valuable. My suggestion is to consume as much content as you can in a variety of formats from a variety of content creators. The repetition will help you learn and reinforce concepts. But ultimately, the best way to learn is by doing.
