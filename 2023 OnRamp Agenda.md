# OnRamp 2023 Agenda

<img src="images/PowerShell-transparent-thumb.jpg" alt="Ms. PowerShell" halign="left" align="left"> This is what you can expect for your OnRamp week.
Your schedule includes attending keynotes and major events in the main conference. You are also invited and encouraged to attend all evening social events. These events are what makes this conference special. Breaks are scheduled to coincide with the main conference so you will have opportunities to mingle and network.

## Attendance

It is expected that you will attend all OnRamp sessions.
You are __not__ permitted to jump back and forth between OnRamp and main conference sessions.

## Course Material

We will be using the OnRamp Slack channel for communications.
If you have questions or comments that you don't feel comfortable asking during the day, please use this channel.
The main conference Slack channels are also great ways to network with other attendees.
Presentation material, including slides and sample code will be available on Github at [https://github.com/devops-collective-inc/OnRamp-2023](https://github.com/devops-collective-inc/OnRamp-2023).
You don't need a Github account to access the site.
You will able able to download a zip file of all content from the site.
Content will be added throughout the week. Final content should be available within a week of the end of the program.

## Your Host

The OnRamp program has been developed with you in mind. The content is designed for beginning IT professionals who want a jump start on their IT career, with an emphasis in automation and Devops. Guest speakers will present some material based on their expertise.

### Jeff Hicks

Jeff Hicks is one of the "old guard" of the PowerShell world.
He is one of the early Microsoft PowerShell MVPs, a well-known author, conference speaker and teacher.
When he isn't writing PowerShell-related books or creating courseware for Pluralsight, you can find him walking the dog, doing a crossword puzzle and enjoying a nice glass of wine, bourbon or scotch.
Although, probably not all at the same time.
You can discover more about Jeff, including where to find him on social media at [https://jdhitsolutions.github.io/](https://jdhitsolutions.github.io/).

## Agenda

Your agenda will consist of live presentations, pre-recorded content, open discussion, and hands-on exercises. This scheduled is always subject to change.

Breaks are scheduled to coincide with the main conference[^1].
Not all presentations have to be formal lectures with PowerPoint.
Some sessions may be nothing more than a conversation with attendees.
